## About

In this simple game, you have to guess as many states by their shape as possible in a limited time.
This is the second version of the app. In future releases, I am planning to add:
* Animation
* Different levels of difficulty
* Ability to log in with Google/Github to keep records about high scores and create global leaderboard

## Tech stack

* [React](https://reactjs.org)

### Typescript

This application uses Typescript.

## Software

For this project, I created designs with Figma myself. This was the first time I used Figma as a designer, so I still have lots of things to learn. You can view designs by [this link.](https://www.figma.com/file/3Hl2fsZmXI7UUTgTFiwGGJ/Design?node-id=0%3A1)
